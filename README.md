# ObbyLib
A Polytoria obby utility library
https://obbylibrary.shadorux.dev/

## Steps on how to use
1. Create a ModuleScript in the ScriptService
2. Copy and Paste the ObbyLib.lua code into it
3. Create a Script and call it what you've decided to utilize
Example: I created a script called DeathPart and pasted the contents of DeathPart.lua
4. Make sure the name of the part is the same as it is in the code.
Refer to https://obbylibrary.shadorux.dev/ for a visual of these steps. (In progress)
